                        <h2 class="card-title text-3xl">What is the difference between local storage and session
                            storage?</h2>
                        <h2 class="text-bold text-xl text-blue-600">Ans: The difference between local storage and
                            session
                            storage</h2>
                        <p><span class="text-xl text-blod">Local Storage:</span> LocalStorage is a property that allows
                            JavaScript sites and apps to save key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date.
                            This means the data stored in the browser will persist even after the browser window is
                            closed.
                        </p>
                        <p><span class="text-xl text-blod">Session Storage:</span> SessionStorage is similar to
                            localStorage; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in
                            sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a
                            particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that
                            specific tab.

                        <h2 class="text-bold text-xl text-blue-600">Ans: The difference between global scope and block
                            scope in
                            JavaScript</h2>
                        <p><span class="text-xl text-blod">Global Scope:</span> The global scope is the scope that
                            contains, and is visible in, all other scopes. In client-side JavaScript, the global scope
                            is generally the web page inside which all the code is being executed.
                        </p>
                        <p><span class="text-xl text-blod">Block Scope:</span> Block Level Scope: This scope restricts
                            the variable that is declared inside a specific block, from access by the outside of the
                            block. The let & const keyword facilitates the variables to be block scoped.
