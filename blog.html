                        <h2 class="text-bold text-xl text-blue-600">Ans: The difference between local storage and
                            session
                            storage</h2>
                        <p><span class="text-xl text-blod">Local Storage:</span> LocalStorage is a property that allows
                            JavaScript sites and apps to save key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date.
                            This means the data stored in the browser will persist even after the browser window is
                            closed.
                        </p>
                        <p><span class="text-xl text-blod">Session Storage:</span> SessionStorage is similar to
                            localStorage; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in
                            sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a
                            particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that
                            specific tab.

                        <p><span class="text-xl text-blod">Global Scope:</span> The global scope is the scope that
                            contains, and is visible in, all other scopes. In client-side JavaScript, the global scope
                            is generally the web page inside which all the code is being executed.

                        <p><span class="text-xl text-blod">Block Scope:</span> Block Level Scope: This scope restricts
                            the variable that is declared inside a specific block, from access by the outside of the
                            block. The let & const keyword facilitates the variables to be block scoped.

                        <p><span class="text-xl text-blod">Event loop: </span>An event loop is something that pulls
                            stuff out of the queue and places it onto the function execution stack whenever the function
                            stack becomes empty.

                        <p><span class="text-xl text-blod">Event Mechanism: </span>The event loop is a mechanism that
                            allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations. When an asynchronous task is started,
                            the event loop will start running. Once the task is completed, the event loop will again
                            check for any other tasks that need to be performed. This process will continue until all
                            tasks have been completed.
